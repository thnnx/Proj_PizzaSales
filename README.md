  - Focus more on restocking monthly for the following top selling months - Januray, March, May, July and August
  - Consider making another menu category (e.i Meaty, Beefy, etc)
  - Focus more on selling L, M, S sizes of pizza instead of XL and XXL, as these two had the lowest sales.
  - Evaluate if you will continue on selling XL and XXL, they only sells a combined of less than 2% of the total sales.
  - Allocate more people during 12PM-2PM and 4PM-7PM to cater the surge or orders during these peak hours.
  - Consider changing the opening hours from 9AM to 10AM or 11AM, and Closing hours to 10PM or 11PM due to low to zero number of orders during these hours, for worker's hour and workload efficiency
  - Focus more on selling the top selling pizzas and evaluate if you can remove / replace the bottomg selling pizzas in the menu.
  - Alternatively, you can make promotional sale for the low selling pizzas like discounts, buy 1 take 1, etc.
