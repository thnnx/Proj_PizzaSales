  - Evaluate if you will continue on selling XL and XXL as these two only sells a combined of less than 2% of the total sales.
  - Alot more workers during the peak hours, 12PM-2PM and 4PM-7PM.
  - Consider changing the opening hours from 9AM to 10AM or 11AM, and Closing hours to 10PM or 11PM for worker's hour and workload efficiency.
